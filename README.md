### 1. <a name="general">General information</a>
HRnet's web application old version is builded with jQuery and used diffrent jQuery plugins as following.

* Date picker plugin
* Modal window plugin - jQuery.modal.js
* Drop-down menus
* Plugin for data tables

Unfortunately some of the jQuery functions doesnÂ´t work properly as expected and slow down the performance of the application.

### 2. <a name="purpose">Purpose</a>

Purpose for this project is to improve the performance of the application. So I need to convert the HRnet old version (builded with `jQuery`) to HRnet new version which is builded with `React`.

This repository is a new HRnet new version which is builded with `React` and use [mui-library](https://mui.com/) to replace the following jQuery plugins.   

* Date picker
* Drop-down menus
* Plugin for data tables

Moreover I have chosen to convert the `Modal-jquery` plugin to  `Modal-react` library and published it as a `npm package`. Plase follow the link 
[kunkanya-modal-react-library](https://github.com/Kunkanya/react-modal-library). 
In its repository you can also follow the steps how to install and how to use as in the [READme.md](https://github.com/Kunkanya/react-modal-library).
